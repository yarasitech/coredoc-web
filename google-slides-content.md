# COREDOC - Google Slides Presentation Content

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** COREDOC
(Use bold, sans-serif font - similar to the website)

**Subtitle:** A protocol for converting buckets of documents of linear text into an infinitely scalable LLM optimized API

**Footer:**

## Slide 2: The Linear Document Problem

**Title:** The Linear Document Problem

**Left Column - Problems:**
‚Ä¢ Can't find information quickly
‚Ä¢ Lost in endless scrolling
‚Ä¢ No connection between topics
‚Ä¢ Context gets lost
‚Ä¢ LLMs can't navigate effectively and get limited by their context window

**Right Column - Visual:**
[Image of a long document with a tiny scrollbar showing user is only 10% through]

**Bottom Text:**
Traditional documents force sequential reading, making it impossible to quickly find related information. Users waste hours scrolling through pages, losing context, and missing connections between concepts.

## Slide 3: Transform Documents into Knowledge Graphs

**Title:** Transform Documents into Knowledge Graphs

**Visual Flow:**

**Center Text:**
COREDOC breaks documents into smart chunks, automatically discovers relationships, and enables instant navigation between related concepts.

**Key Benefits:**
‚Ä¢ Instant navigation
‚Ä¢ Smart connections
‚Ä¢ Preserved context
‚Ä¢ LLM-optimized API
‚Ä¢ Infinitely scalable

## Slide 4: The COREDOC Algorithm

**Title:** The COREDOC Algorithm

**5-Step Process:**

1. **Extract Structure** üìã
   Identify headings, sections, hierarchies

2. **Create Chunks** ‚úÇÔ∏è
   Split into 500-2000 character pieces

3. **Find Keywords** üîç
   NLP-powered term extraction

4. **Build Links** üîó
   Connect related concepts

5. **Output JSON** üöÄ
   LLM-ready API format

## Slide 5: Smart Document Chunking

**Title:** Preserves Hierarchy, Optimizes Size

**Visual:**
[Show a document being split into 4 chunks with size indicators]
- Chunk 1: 850 chars
- Chunk 2: 1,200 chars
- Chunk 3: 950 chars
- Chunk 4: 1,100 chars

**Key Points:**
‚Ä¢ Maintains document structure
‚Ä¢ Preserves parent-child relationships
‚Ä¢ Optimized for human reading and LLM processing
‚Ä¢ Semantic coherence preserved

## Slide 6: Intelligent Cross-References

**Title:** NLP-Powered Cross-References

**Process Flow:**
1. Text: "The neural network architecture uses backpropagation to optimize the loss function..."
2. Keywords Extracted:
   - neural network (0.92)
   - backpropagation (0.87)
   - loss function (0.85)
3. Automatic connections created between chunks sharing keywords

**Bottom Text:**
Natural language processing identifies important terms and creates meaningful connections between related sections.

## Design Guidelines

- **Font:** Use clean, modern sans-serif (like Inter or SF Pro)
- **Colors:** 
  - Primary: Black (#000000)
  - Secondary: White (#FFFFFF)
  - Accent: Blue (#3498db) for keywords/highlights
  - Gray scale for supporting text
- **Layout:** Plenty of white space, minimalist design
- **Logo:** COREDOC in bold, all caps, tight letter spacing (-0.05em)
